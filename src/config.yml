customEvents:
  # This is a basic event example
  # All messages support color codes using the '&' character
  myEvent:  # Event name, can be anything
    # Time in seconds before event is triggered (REQUIRED)
    time: 5000
    # All the following are optional:
    # If this is false then the event will not be triggered, if it isn't set then the event will run
    enabled: false
    # Command to execute when event is triggered, the command is run as console
    command: 'mycommand'
    # Message to send to all players when event is triggered
    message: 'mymessage'
    # Title to send to all players when event is triggered
    title: 'This will be displayed as a title'

    # Change PvP status when event is triggered
    pvp: true
    # Change Meetup status when event is triggered

    # Change world border when event is triggered
    # Format is SIZE/SECONDS, SIZE is the size the border should goto, SECONDS is how long it should take to get there
    border: 10/100

  # Some recommended events:
  # If you remove them then some scenarios will not work, for example SkyHigh only makes people take damage at Meetup
  # The scenarios will still register PvP and Meetup as long as an event has pvp: true or meetup: true in it
